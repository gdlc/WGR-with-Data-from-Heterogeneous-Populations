# WGR-with-Data-from-Heterogeneous-Populations

># Project Pipeline
1. [QC protocol](https://github.com/sudhaveturi/WGR-with-Data-from-Heterogeneous-Populations/blob/master/QC%20protocol.md) for MESA, BC, UIDS
2. For MESA :
    * Perform QC and get final set of genotypes and phenotypes for stratified, across-cluster, and bi-cluster analyses
    * Finalize [simulation protocol](https://github.com/sudhaveturi/WGR-with-Data-from-Heterogeneous-Populations/blob/master/SimulationProtocol_MESA.md.pdf) and run simulations
    * Run stratified, bi-cluster, and across-cluster analyses
3. For BC and UIDS:
    * Merge genotypes form two different genotyping platforms
    * Perform QC and get final set of genotypes and phenotypes for stratified, across-cluster, and bi-cluster analyses
    * Run stratified, bi-cluster, and across-cluster analyses
4. [Biobank UK](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001779)? (~500,000 individuals, 800,000 SNPs with 20 year follow-up selected from dbSNP and 1000 Genomes Project; data from Whites, Blacks, Asians)
5. [ARIC] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000398.v3.p1) (~12000 individuals; data from Blacks and Whites)? 
5. All analyses with GWAS-significant SNPs only?
